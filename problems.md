# Unsolved Problems in Mathematics

The problems below have resisted rigorous proofs despite significant progress.
Each description includes a brief summary and a reference for further study.

## 1. Riemann Hypothesis
The hypothesis asserts that every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function
lies on the critical line with real part one-half.  Resolving it would illuminate
the distribution of prime numbers and has profound consequences throughout
analytic number theory. [^riemann]

## 2. P vs NP
This problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be verified quickly
(in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly.  A proof either way would
reshape computer science, impacting cryptography, optimisation and complexity
theory at large. [^pvsnp]

## 3. Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
For an elliptic curve over the rationals, the conjecture links the number of
independent rational points to the behaviour of the curve’s L-function at
``s = 1``.  It provides a deep connection between arithmetic geometry and
analytic objects. [^bsd]

## 4. Hodge Conjecture
The conjecture proposes that certain cohomology classes on a non-singular
projective variety can be represented by algebraic cycles.  It remains one of
the central open problems in algebraic geometry. [^hodge]

## 5. Yang–Mills Existence and Mass Gap
This problem seeks a rigorous quantum field theory for non-abelian gauge fields
that exhibits a mass gap, meaning particles possess positive lower bounds for
their masses.  It is crucial for understanding the mathematical foundations of
particle physics. [^yangmills]

## 6. Navier–Stokes Existence and Smoothness
The question asks whether smooth solutions to the three-dimensional
Navier–Stokes equations exist for all time, or if singularities can form from
smooth initial conditions.  A resolution would clarify the mathematics of fluid
flow. [^navierstokes]

## 7. Goldbach’s Conjecture
Goldbach proposed that every even integer greater than two is the sum of two
primes.  Despite overwhelming numerical evidence and partial results, a general
proof remains unknown. [^goldbach]

## 8. Twin Prime Conjecture
The conjecture posits that there exist infinitely many pairs of primes separated
by two.  Recent advances have narrowed the permissible gap, but infinitude is
still unproven. [^twinprime]

## 9. Collatz Conjecture
Starting from any positive integer, repeatedly applying the Collatz map (halve
even numbers, triple odd numbers and add one) appears to eventually reach one.
Proving this behaviour for every starting value has eluded mathematicians for
decades. [^collatz]

## 10. abc Conjecture
This conjecture links the prime factors of three integers ``a``, ``b`` and
``c`` satisfying ``a + b = c``.  It predicts that, except for finitely many
triples, ``c`` cannot be too large relative to the product of the distinct prime
factors of ``abc``.  Its resolution would unify numerous results in number
theory. [^abc]
